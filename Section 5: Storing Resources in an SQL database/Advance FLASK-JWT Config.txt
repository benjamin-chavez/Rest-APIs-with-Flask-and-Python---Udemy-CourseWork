Advanced Flask-JWT Configuration
Attached to this lecture as a Resource is a short guide on how to configure Flask-JWTâ€”it includes things like:

Changing the authentication endpoint (by default, /auth);
Changing the token expiration time (by default, 5 minutes);
Changing the authentication key name (by default, username);
Changing the authentication response body (by default, only contains access_token); and
Changing the error handlers.
Check it out either via the blog (http://tecladocode.com/blog/learn-python-advanced-configuration-of-flask-jwt/) 
or the PDF attached.

Kind regards,
